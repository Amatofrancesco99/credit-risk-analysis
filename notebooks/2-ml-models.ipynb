    "The objective of this analysis is to understand which are the factors that are more effecting the probability of having an high credit risk of a given company, using initially only the data of the explanatory variables of 2019 to predict the credit risk of 2020 (true values vs forecasts). <br>\n",
    "Then it can be added new explanatory variables 'delayed' e.g. leverage to 2018, 2017, etc. <br>\n",
    "After understood some general behavior (through the previous notebook), this specific notebook has the objective to build different models to predict the credit risk level (low/high) in an year for each company, and also compare each presented model (in order to both interpret them and see their accuracy).\n",
